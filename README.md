# PSSPCRF2022

#1 Dataset:

Please download from this website "https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GvBOqpLvobwo0wmuFEG_9Q?pwd=PSSP".
The code is "PSSP".

Download data and put them in ./data folder.

The 72 features are:

[0,20) HMM

[20,42) one-hot: amino acid residues, with the order of  'A', 'C', 'E', 'D', 'G', 'F', 'I', 'H', 'K', 'M', 'L', 'N', 'Q', 'P', 'S', 'R', 'T', 'W', 'V', 'Y', 'X','NoSeq'

[42,63) PSSM

[63.72) Secondary structure labels, with the sequence of 'C', 'B', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'H', 'S', 'T','NoSeq'


#2 The version of pytorch is 1.1


#3 Our trained weights for CRNN

Please download from this website "https://pan.baidu.com/s/1MQPl9E91SQJSYsG1a1MwxA?pwd=PSSP".
The code is "PSSP".

Download our parameters and put them in ./parameter folder.

The results can be obtained by running CRF.py without trainning.


#4 The key for the code will be available when this paper is accepted.

The reviewers can send email to 452179111@qq.com for the key.
